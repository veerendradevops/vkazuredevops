# Continuous Delivery - before the hands-on lab setup guide 

## Requirements

1.  Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.

  - Trial subscriptions will _not_ work

  - To complete this lab setup, ensure your account includes the following:

    - Has the [Owner](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/build-in-roles#owner) built-in role for the subscription you use.

    - Is a [Member](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/users-default-permissions#member-and-guest-users) user in the Azure AD tenant you use. (Guest users will not have the necessary permissions.)

2. A Microsoft [GitHub](https://github.com) account.

3. Local machine or a virtual machine configured with:

    - A browser, preferably Chrome for consistency with the lab implementation tests.

4. Git for Windows

5. Powershell

## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 60 minutes

You should follow all of the steps provided in this section _before_ taking part in the hands-on lab ahead of time.

### Task 1: Create the Project Repo

In this task, you will create an account in [GitHub](https://github.com) and use `git` to add lab files to a new repository.

1. Create a new repository in GitHub for the lab files.

    - Browse to [GitHub](https://github.com) in your browser and log into your account.

    - Create a new repository.

      - Click on the `New` button.

        ![Screenshot of the `New Repository` button in a GitHub profile](../Media/b4-task1-step1-1.png "New Repository Button")

    
      - Provide a name and description for your new repository.

        > **Note**: Suggested name for the repository is `mcw-continuous-delivery-lab-files`.

        ![Screenshot of the `New Repository` creation form in GitHub](../Media/b4-task1-step1-2.png "New Repository Creation Form")

      - Click on the `Create Repository` button to create the new repository.

        ![Screenshot of the created repository in GitHub](../Media/b4-task1-step1-3.png "Created Repository Page")

2. Clone the lab repository.

  - Create an appropriate workspace folder and navigate to it in a Powershell terminal.

    > **Note**: Suggested name for the workspace folder is `C:\Workspaces\lab`, for example.

    ```pwsh
    C:
    mkdir C:\Workspaces
    cd C:\Workspaces
    mkdir lab
    cd lab
    ```

  - Type the following command and press `<ENTER>`:

    ```pwsh
    git clone https://github.com/solliancenet/microsoft-mcw-continuous-delivery.git
    ```

  - Create a folder for the GitHub repository created in Step 1 and navigate to it in Powershell.

    ```pwsh
    mkdir mcw-continuous-delivery-lab-files
    cd mcw-continuous-delivery-lab-files
    ```

  - Copy lab files from the MCW lab repository to the new folder.

    ```pwsh
    Copy-Item '..\microsoft-mcw-continuous-delivery\Hands-on lab\lab-files\*' -Destination ./ -Recurse
    ```

  - Initialize folder as a git repository, commit, and submit contents to remote GitHub branch `main` in the lab files repository created in Step 1.

    > **Note**: The URI of the lab files GitHub repository created in Step 1 will differ from that in the example below.

    ```pwsh
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    git branch -M main
    git remote add origin https://github.com/hatboyzero/mcw-continuous-delivery-lab-files.git
    git push -u origin main
    ```

### Task 2: Create GitHub Personal Access Token

1. Log in to your GitHub account.

2. Create a Personal Access Token as [described here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).  Ensure that the following scopes are checked when configuring your GitHub Personal Access Token.

    - `repo` - Full control of private repositories
    - `workflow` - Update GitHub Action workflows
    - `write:packages` - Upload packages to GitHub Package Registry
    - `delete:packages` - Delete packages from GitHub Package Registry
    - `read:org` - Read org and team membership, read org projects

    ![Screenshot of configured scopes for a GitHub Personal Access Token](../Media/b4-task2-step2-1.png "GitHub Personal Access Token Scope Configuration")

3. Copy the GitHub Personal Access Token somewhere safe and accessible for later use during the lab. **DO NOT COMMIT THIS VALUE TO YOUR REPO!**

### Task 3: Create Azure DevOps Personal Access Token

1.  Log in to your existing Azure DevOps account or create a new account on https://dev.azure.com.

    ![Screenshot of Azure DevOps Portal](../Media/b4-task3-step1-1.png "Azure DevOps Portal")

2. Create an Azure DevOps Personal Access Token as [described here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops&tabs=preview-page).  For the purposes of this lab, please ensure your Azure DevOps Personal Access Token is configured with a `Full access` scope.

    > **Note**: A `Full access` scope is not recommended for Azure DevOps Personal Access Tokens in live development and production environments. We are only using this scope for the purposes of this lab.

3. Copy the Azure DevOps Personal Access Token somewhere safe and accessible to you for later use during the lab. **DO NOT COMMIT THIS VALUE TO YOUR REPO!**

4. Create a `Fabrikam` project in Azure DevOps for use in the lab.

You should follow all steps provided *before* performing the Hands-on lab.
