# Continuous delivery in Azure DevOps whiteboard design session student guide

## Abstract and learning objectives 

In this whiteboard design session, you will learn how to design a solution with a combination of Azure Resource Manager templates and Azure DevOps to enable continuous delivery with several Azure PaaS services.

At the end of this workshop, you will be better able to build templates to automate cloud infrastructure and reduce error-prone manual processes. In addition, you'll learn how to design a deployment and monitoring architecture using Azure Resource Manager templates to provision Azure resources, Application Insights for deep application monitoring, and Azure DevOps as a source code repository and build/deploy pipeline.

## Step 1: Review the customer case study 

**Outcome**

Analyze your customer's needs.

Timeframe: 15 minutes

Directions: With all participants in the session, the facilitator/SME presents an overview of the customer case study along with technical tips.

1.  Meet your table participants and trainer.

2.  Read all of the directions for steps 1-3 in the student guide.

3.  As a table team, review the following customer case study.

### Customer situation

Fabrikam Medical Conferences provides conference web site services tailored to the medical community. They started out 10 years ago building a few conference sites for a small conference organizer. Since then, word of mouth has spread, and Fabrikam 
Medical Conferences is now a well-known industry brand. They currently handle over 100 conferences per year and growing.

Websites for medical conferences are typically low budget web sites because the conferences usually have between 100 to 1500 attendees. At the same time, the conference owners have significant customization and change demands that require turnaround on a dime to the live sites. These changes can impact various aspects of the system from UI through to the back end, including conference registration and payment terms.

Tailspin Toys saw the positive potential of the cloud and moved its IT infrastructure, with no significant re-architecture, into Microsoft Azure around six months ago. Now that its business is running successfully in the cloud, it has started a series of process improvements to become a more agile company with a specific focus on delivering frequent feature updates and fixes to its public website. Alex Montgomery, VP of sales and the head of its online business team, says that, "Even though our products are better, our competitors are generating more online sales than we are. For every feature that we deliver to our website, they have delivered 2 or 3. Our development processes are too cumbersome and slow for us to build quality code at that pace."

**Public website and data layer**

The VP of Engineering at Fabrikam, Susan Withers, has a team of 12 developers who handle all aspects of development, testing, deployment, and operational management of their customer sites. Due to customer demands, they have issues with the efficiency and reliability the conference websites. This mainly caused by an inefficient development and operations workflow.

In the current situation, the conference sites are hosted on-premises with the following topology and platform implementation:

- The conference web sites are built with the MEAN stack (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node.js).
- Web sites and APIs are hosted on Linux machines.
- MongoDB is also running on a separate cluster of Linux machines.

### Customer needs 

1.  Be able to automatically and continuously deploy new software builds to the Azure App Service web app.

2.  Ensure that continuously deployed builds to the cloud do not interfere with the production copy of the solution.

3.  Identify an automated way of deploying to different environments for "development," "test," and "production" so that changes or deployments to one environment do not affect the others.

4.  Configure the automated builds to first require that a full series of unit tests pass before a deployment is started.

5.  Provide a search feature and visual dashboard for the application logs so the developers can more quickly resolve help desk tickets.

6.  Enhance the logged data from the front-end website to give the developers a more complete picture of the application's performance and behavior.

    - Browser information such as browser page load time and user activity per page.

    - Application dependency metrics such as request times and request failures for communication with the database or other services.

7.  Implement proactive diagnostics to generate automatic alerts for unusual application behavior including aberrant request response time, dependency response time, and page load time.

### Customer objections 

1.  We do not want to be locked in to a specific source control repository. We are evaluating GitHub and Azure DevOps and need to be able to change between them without frustrating rework.

2.  We do not want the developers to be able to make changes to the Azure resources even though they will have access to make source code changes.

3.  If developers can deploy directly to the cloud, will that expose us to the same quality problems we had before when untested code was promoted to production?

4.  How much of an impact will these process changes have on our development cadence? Will learning this place a new burden on the developers?

5.  Our developers are already having a challenge learning how to use Git; will adding a continuous deployment system on top of that slow them down and confuse them even more?

## Step 2: Design a proof of concept solution

**Outcome**

Design a solution and prepare to present the solution to the target customer audience in a 15-minute chalk-talk format.

Timeframe: 60 minutes

**Business needs**

Directions:  With all participants at your table, answer the following questions and list the answers on a flip chart:

1.  Who should you present this solution to? Who is your target customer audience? Who are the decision makers?

2.  What customer business needs do you need to address with your solution?

**Design**

Directions: With all participants at your table, respond to the following questions on a flip chart:

*Continuous Integration and Deployment*

1.  What available system should you use to automate software builds and deployments of the application?

2.  Explain how you can continuously deploy new builds directly to the cloud without interfering with the production site.

3.  Document how to integrate unit tests into the continuous delivery process so that when a test fails to pass, the deployment process is flagged and stopped.

4.  Explain how you can test a new build simultaneously with an existing build, like an A/B test.

5.  Why shouldn't we have multiple long-lived branches in source control?

6.  Create a plan on how to switch the source control location from Azure DevOps to GitHub.

*Enhance system logging functionality*

1.  Implement a solution that will enable the logs to be searchable and visible in an online dashboard.

2.  Implement a solution to enhance the application logs to provide more useful performance and application behavior details, specifically around browser metrics and application dependencies. Discuss which visualization, or dashboard, options exist for the log results. Existing App Service logs already cover these topics:

    -  **Detailed Error Logging**---detailed error information for HTTP status codes that indicate a failure (status code 400 or greater).

    -  **Failed Request Tracing**---detailed information on failed requests, including a trace of the Internet Information Server IIS components used to process the request and the time taken in each component.

    -  **Web Server Logging**---information about HTTP transactions using the W3C extended log file format.

    -  **Application Diagnostics**---trace messages as defined in the source code.

    -  **Deployment Logs**

**Prepare**

Directions: With all participants at your table:

1.  Identify any customer needs that are not addressed with the proposed solution.

2.  Identify the benefits of your solution.

3.  Determine how you will respond to the customer's objections.

Prepare a 15-minute chalk-talk style presentation to the customer.

## Step 3: Present the solution

**Outcome**

Present a solution to the target customer audience in a 15-minute chalk-talk format.

Timeframe: 30 minutes

**Presentation**

Directions:

1.  Pair with another table.

2.  One table is the Microsoft team and the other table is the customer.

3.  The Microsoft team presents their proposed solution to the customer.

4.  The customer makes one of the objections from the list of objections.

5.  The Microsoft team responds to the objection.

6.  The customer team gives feedback to the Microsoft team.

7.  Tables switch roles and repeat Steps 2-6.

##  Wrap-up 

Timeframe:  15 minutes

Directions:  Tables reconvene with the larger group to hear the facilitator/SME share the preferred solution for the case study.
